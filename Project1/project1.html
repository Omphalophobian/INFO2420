        <h2>Website Evaluation Questions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt></dt>What was your first impression of this site?</dt>
            <dd>It was a well-organized and visually appealing website with a clean layout and intuitive navigation. I didn't think it was that unique, but when I looked at the other sites we had to choose from, I realized it was one of the better ones.</dd>
            <dt>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</dt>
            <dd>This website features a classic menu button in the top left corner, with the main content area to the right of the menu. The layout is clean and organized, making it easy to navigate. I especially love the bookmark hanging from the menu with popular navigation options.</dd>
            <dt>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</dt>
            <dd>The structure makes sense because it follows a standard web design pattern, with a clear header, navigation menu, and content area. This organization helps users find what they're looking for quickly.</dd>
            <dt>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it? Why?</dt>
            <dd>The graphics and layout enhance the site by providing visual interest without overwhelming the user. The website uses a consistent style of illustration, complete with a cohesive color palette. I love the occasional use of illustrations in a silly style that adds personality to the site.</dd>
            <dt>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
reasonable?</dt>
            <dd>The load time was practically instantanous, which is very reasonable for a modern website. I did have a great internet connection when I visited the site.</dd>
            <dt>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</dt>
            <dd>The text color and size were readable. I did disagree with the formatting of the "17th Annual Customer Choice Awards" section, due to the inconsistent graphical style and small font.</dd>
            <dt>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
navigation well done?</dt>
            <dd>Like I mentioned before, the inclusion of a bookmark style menu with quick options on the side was really helpful, as it stayed present when you scrolled down the page. I did feel it to be a little disorienting when the menu was selected, as the resulting screen filled the whole window.</dd>
            <dt>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, the site maintains a consistent color scheme and visual style across all pages, which contributes to a cohesive user experience.</dd>
            <dt>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</dt>
            <dd>It does great deciding what element to remove and adjust depending on the window size. In all my testing and navigating, I couldn't find a page that had text overflow issues.</dd>
            <dt>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</dt>
            <dd>The site's unique use of illustrations and its consistent visual identity across all pages stand out as particularly well executed features. I especially appreciated the organization and simplicity of the product lists. It was really easy to find a product and view its details.</dd>
